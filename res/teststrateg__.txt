Tools Suggest a tool to use to keep track of testing of the
different things above. Expectation After ended project, the
company will have a test process described, in paper,
which the company can implement (follow). The expectation is
that someone within the company can make sure that the
process is followed.  It should be easy to understand where
the company is in the test process, independent of if we are
testing new SW release from supplier on existing HW or if it
is new HW. The company also expect to get a suggestion about
a tool which works well with our business and what we are
doing.  Profinder – erfarna konsulter inom IT, Teknik och
