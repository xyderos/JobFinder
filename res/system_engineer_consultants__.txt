Your challenge will be to Systemize solutions for our
products regarding Operability and Maintanability, that are
fault tolerant and self-servicing. This includes for
example: ·  How and what information shall we log ·  Can we
do self-recovery from failures ·  What types of self-tests
can we perform   Systemize solutions for simplified and
robust operation of our products. The products must handle
and adapt to environmental conditions such as temperature.
Simplification and robustness can include ·  configuration
of sub system resources ·  visibility of vital parameters
·  fault tolerance such as recoveries or reconfigurations
·  pinpointing of problems for operation personnel and
